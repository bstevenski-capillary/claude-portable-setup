# SessionStart tooling-rot siren.
#
# Yells about degraded local tooling BEFORE any work starts. On findings it
# injects a loud warning into session context AND shows the user a systemMessage.
#
# The hot path is local-only and <1s — it never waits on the network. The npm
# registry check reads a CACHE file written by a detached background refresh,
# so a slow or absent network can delay freshness but can never delay (or, via
# the hook timeout, silently kill) SessionStart. That distinction is the whole
# design: a siren that hangs is a siren that reports nothing, which is
# indistinguishable from a siren that reports all-clear.
#
# Born of an incident where a test toolchain ran silently broken for ~7 weeks
# while every surface reported green.
#
# Denominator honesty: if a watchlist EXISTS but covers nothing (empty or
# unparseable), that is reported — you intended coverage and have none. If no
# watchlist exists at all, this exits silently: you never asked it to watch
# anything, and a siren that fires every session is a siren that stops being
# read. See "check the denominator" in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.
