#
# Why this exists: this is SC-3. `tools/check-drift.sh` reserves exit **2** for
# "nothing of this bundle is installed at this root, so nothing was compared" —
# an abstention. A CI job that shelled out to the drift check and accepted any
# non-1 status would therefore go green on an install that copied *zero files*,
# and the report would be indistinguishable from a real pass. So this script
# demands exit 0 specifically, and treats 2 as the failure it is.
#
# What it proves, in one sentence: a stranger with no ~/.claude, no overlay, and
# nothing of the author's on their machine can run INSTALL.md and end up with a
# working core (STRATEGY.md, "Who it's for"). Every other suite in this repo
# exercises the artifacts; this one exercises the act of installing them.
#
# Read-only with respect to the real $HOME. With no argument it installs into a
# fresh `mktemp -d` and removes it afterwards; given a path, it installs there
# and leaves it alone, because a script that deletes a directory a caller handed
# it is a worse tool than one that only cleans up after itself.
#
#   ./tools/bare-install.sh            # scratch root, cleaned up
#   ./tools/bare-install.sh /tmp/probe # your root, left in place
